- Attendance in mock tests alone does **not** qualify for the bonus.

## Eligibility Criteria

### OPPE1:
- Completion of the **OPPE System Compatibility Test (SCT)** is mandatory.
- OPPE1 will **not** be scheduled for students who fail the SCT.

### OPPE2:
- **GrPA (Graded Programming Assignments):** Average of the best **5 out of the first 7** scores must be **≥ 40/100**.
- **Weekly Assessments:** Average of the best **5 out of the first 7** (objective + programming) scores must be **≥ 40/100**.

### End Term Exam:
- The **weekly assessments** (objective + programming) must have an **average score of ≥ 40/100**.

## Final Course Grade Requirements:
- Must attend the **End Term Exam**.
- Must score **≥ 40/100** in at least **one programming exam** (OPPE1 or OPPE2).

## Final Course Score Calculation:
Formula: **T = 0.1 GAA1 (objective) + 0.1GAA2 (programming) + 0.1Qz1+ 0.4F+ 0.25 max(PE1, PE2) + 0.15 min(PE1, PE2) — capped to 100**.

Where:
- **GAA1:** Average score in the **best 10 out of 11** graded objective assignments.
- **GAA2:** Average score in the **best 10 out of 11** graded programming assignments.
- **Qz1:** Quiz 1 score (**0** if not attempted).
- **PE1:** OPPE1 score (**0** if not attempted).
- **PE2:** OPPE2 score (**0** if not attempted).
- **F:** Final exam score.

# Lecture Content

## L1: Introduction to Programming
- Programming is like learning a new language to communicate with computers.
- **Python is chosen because:**
  - Widely used today.
  - Easy to learn.
  - Powerful and versatile.
- **Evolution of programming languages:** From **Pascal, COBOL, and C** to modern **Python**.
- **Learning programming is like learning to drive a car**: Hands-on practice is essential.
- **The course focuses on practical coding** with minimal theoretical lectures.

## L2: Introduction to Replit
- Coding today is easier than before, thanks to online platforms.
- **Replit (replit.com)** allows programming directly in a browser without installations.

### Steps:
1. Open a browser and go to **Replit**.
2. Click **Start Coding**.
3. Sign in using a **Google account**.
4. Start writing **Python programs instantly**.

- This platform will be used throughout the course for hands-on coding.

### Lecture : A Quick introduction to Variables
**Main Topics Covered**

* Variables and assignment
* Basic arithmetic operations in programming
* Incrementing variables
* User input and output
* Data type conversion (integers)

**Key Concepts & Definitions**

* **Variable:** A named storage location that holds a value. (e.g., `a = 10`, `b = 20`, `n`)
* **Assignment:** The process of assigning a value to a variable. (e.g., `a = 10`)
* **Print Statement:** A command that displays output to the user. (e.g., `print(a)`, `print("enter a number")`)
* **Incrementing:** Increasing the value of a variable by a certain amount (usually 1). (e.g., `a = a + 1`)
* **Integer (int):** A whole number.
* **User Input:** Data provided by the user during program execution.

**Core Insights & Takeaways**

* Variables store values that can be manipulated and displayed.
* Programming uses assignment statements differently than traditional mathematics.
* Incrementing variables is a common and useful programming technique.
* User input allows programs to interact with the user.
* The `int()` function converts user input into an integer data type, allowing for mathematical operations.
* The order of execution is critical in programs.

**Examples & Case Studies**

* `a = 10; print(a)`: Demonstrates variable assignment and printing.
* `a = 10; b = 20; print(a + b); print(a * b)`: Shows basic arithmetic operations.
* `a = 10; a = a + 1; print(a)`: Illustrates incrementing a variable.
* `print("enter a number"); n = int(input()); print(n); print(n + 1); print(n + 2); print(n + 3)`: Demonstrates user input, type conversion, and further arithmetic.

### Lecture: Variables and Input Statement
**Main Topics Covered**

* String variables and user input
* Integer variables and user input
* Combining strings and variables in print statements
* Interactive program design
* Error handling and debugging

**Key Concepts & Definitions**

* **String (str):** A sequence of characters. (e.g., "hello", "Sudarshan", "Mysore")
* **String Input:** Receiving text input from the user. (e.g., `str(input())`)
* **Integer Input:** Receiving numerical input from the user and converting it to an integer. (e.g., `int(input())`)
* **Variable Scope:** The region of a program where a variable can be accessed.
* **Concatenation:** Joining strings together.
* **Debugging:** The process of identifying and removing errors from a program.

**Core Insights & Takeaways**

* Different data types (strings, integers) require different input handling.
* Variables allow programs to store and manipulate user input.
* Print statements can combine strings and variables for dynamic output.
* Interactive programs can be designed to personalize user experiences.
* Errors are a normal part of programming and can be used for learning.
* Variable names must be unique to prevent data overwriting.
* The importance of understanding variable scope.

**Examples & Case Studies**

* `name = str(input("Type in your name: ")); print("Hello, " + name)`: Demonstrates string input and concatenation.
* `place = str(input("Which place are you in? ")); print("How is the weather in " + place + "?")`: Shows how to capture and display user place input.
* `age = int(input("What is your age? ")); print("Good to know you are " + str(age) + " years old.")`: Illustrates integer input and combining it with string output.
* The example of using different names for variables, when asking for user name, and user location, to prevent overwriting data.
* The debugging of the code, when the variable P was not defined.
